# Assigment-7-Bayes-Classification
data science


This is a Pycharm project.

## basic info
We first preprocess the data, to see the shape and if there are null values. After that, we split the dataset into married and divorced to plot some graphs about the data.

The last thing we did was to train and test a model using sklearn.naive_bayes  GaussianNB.
